Fiddle with your react, without need for npm installs. 
Ready to play just after git clone.

Supports:
* React 15.4
* Less
* Babel (ES2015 plus experimental stages)

Easilly swap versions by changing CDN links in index.html.

You need to use http server to test your code. Recommended options:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

BrowserSync
